A crappy basic keylogger

"Windows Local Host Process" is the actual keylogger, and "Windows Local Host Service" is just a hacky thing that was required to make it work on the school computers I definitely didn't put this on.

To use: download the exe, and run it once. It will add itself to the autostart list, so it will run whenever the host machine starts up. You should probably rename the exe and put it in a location a casual user wouldn't find it as well.
It will store it's logs in C:\Users\username\AppData\Windows

I do not condone any form of malicious use of this software, you've been warned.
Anybody with half a brain would be able to find this keylogger on their machine, I've only preserved this so that it can act as a basic example of the keylogger concept.
